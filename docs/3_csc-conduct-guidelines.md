    - **3.1.2.1**&emsp;Any concerns about the sportsmanship of other players or teams within CSC should be directed to the League Staff and your GM. Public witch-hunts of CSC teams or players is unacceptable and will be considered harassment.

- **3.1.3**&emsp;If at any point a player feels that they have been unfairly punished for violating behavior guidelines, they should file an appeal with the arbiters by opening a ticket using the ⁠⁠appeal-ticket-creation channel. In the event that this is not possible, they may DM an admin, head mod, or head arbiter.

- **3.1.4**&emsp;Any Admin or Mod in CSC may require a player to change their name or profile picture if it is deemed to be inappropriate.

- **3.1.6**&emsp;No league member may offer or accept non-league assets/benefits (cash, skins, etc.) in exchange for in-league assets (ie picks, players, franchises, elevated positions) or for any form of preferential treatment.

- **3.1.7**&emsp;Poaching, or conspiring to persuade a contracted player to leave their franchise and without permission from that player's GM, is prohibited.

Disciplinary action will only be taken with direct evidence of contact or intent to poach.

&emsp;

## 3.2 GM Behavior

- **3.2.1**&emsp;General Managers are expected to be trustworthy, mature, kind, and focused on helping their players and teams at all times. They should also be regularly available to their players and to staff in order to fulfill their responsibilities.

- **3.2.2**&emsp;GMs are responsible for the following: Knowing the league rules, drafting players, leading their franchise in a positive way and creating a fun environment for their players, helping and being responsive to their players as needed.

- **3.2.3**&emsp;Admins reserve the right to remove a GM at any point, without warning, if they feel that a GM is not meeting the above expectations.

- **3.2.4**&emsp;The position of General Manager is considered a privilege, not a right, for all members of CSC who achieve the position. All GMs are reviewed following incidents of concern and after every season, if needed.

&emsp;

## 3.3 Privileged Knowledge

- **3.3.1**&emsp;Some members of CSC (GMs, AGMs, Staff, Admins, and certain others) may have privileged knowledge. This information falls into one of two groups.

    - **3.3.1.1**&emsp;The first group includes player contract MMRs, the contract MMR formula, and related information, as well as certain topics indicated by Staff or Admins. Information in this group may not be shared with anyone outside of it.

    - **3.3.1.2**&emsp;The second group includes transaction information for franchises, as well as certain topics indicated by Staff or Admins. Information in this group may only be shared with the permission of the appropriate individual or individuals (which could be yourself).

- **3.3.2**&emsp;This expectation of keeping certain knowledge secret continues even after you no longer have direct access to it.

- **3.3.3**&emsp;Sharing this knowledge intentionally may lead to severe consequences, up to and including permanent removal from CSC.

&emsp;

- **3.4.2**&emsp;Accusations of cheating must be made either through the ticket system in #roles-and-tickets, or through a DM with an admin. Cheating accusations are not to be made in public channels, and may lead to a punishment for the offender.

- **3.4.3**&emsp;Upon receiving a cheating accusation, the admins will assemble a committee to review the player's gameplay.

    - **3.4.3.1**&emsp;The committee will be made of the following

        - **3.4.3.1.1**&emsp;Three to five highly skilled former or active CSC players.

        - **3.4.3.1.2**&emsp;Nobody associated with the accused.

    - **3.4.3.2**&emsp;The committee will individually review one or more demo files of the accused's gameplay as they see fit until a conclusion is reached.

    - **3.4.3.3**&emsp;Upon completion of the demo review, a unanimous minus one vote is required to remove the player from the league
 
- **3.4.4**&emsp;The use of any methods intended to bypass Valve's default SOCD behavior (such as Snap Tap) is banned in all league matches. If a player is discovered to have used such methods any matches in which they were used will be considered a forfeit win for the opposing team and the player issued a formal warning. Any subsequent infraction will result in a ban of one match day for each match in which they were used and the match being a forfeit win for the opponent. Recurring usage may result in season or permanent bans at admin discretion.

&emsp;

## 3.5 Staff Bans

- **3.5.1**&emsp;Admins may give out staff bans at their discretion with a vote of all but one admin in favor to enact the ban.

    - **3.5.1.1**&emsp;They may be given out for a variety of reasons including coinciding with certain serious strikes, severe character shortcomings, and intense demonstrated public unprofessionalism.

- **3.5.2**&emsp;Staff bans will last 1-3 seasons (the current season not counting towards this) as appropriate.

    - **3.5.2.1**&emsp;Each prior staff ban (not successfully appealed) will increase this length by a season.

    - **3.5.2.2**&emsp;A member that has served a staff ban (that has not been successfully appealed or forgiven) is permanently ineligible from positions with elevated authority or access to privileged information, listed below
        
        - Admin
        - Mod
        - Arbiter
        - Transaction Manager
        - (A)GM
        - Numbers Committee
        - Rules Committee
        - Committee Head

- **3.5.3**&emsp;Staff bans may be appealed immediately. After an unsuccessful appeal, members must wait 6 months following the conclusion of the appeal to initiate another one.

    - **3.5.3.1**&emsp;This appeal process requires a vote of all but one arbiter to remove the staff ban.

    - **3.5.3.2**&emsp;This process should be followed if new evidence is discovered regarding the incident(s) or there were new claims of issues with the initial ban process including misconduct, bias, or abuse. This process is separate from strike removal by appeal, but may happen in parallel.

    - **3.5.3.3**&emsp;If successful, the staff ban is removed.

- **3.5.4**&emsp;Staff bans may be forgiven (not removed) after ban expiration with 6 months between failed attempts.

    - **3.5.4.1**&emsp;The review group will be comprised of all admins, moderators, and arbiters. For the group to consider the request 2 members of this group must endorse a review after being initiated by the offending member. A 2/3 majority of the group will be required to forgive the ban.

    - **3.5.4.2**&emsp;If successful, the member may again seek any CSC position.
