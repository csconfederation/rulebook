# League Processes

---

## 4.1 General League Notes

- **4.1.1**&emsp;CSC is composed of a series of tiers and franchises. Each franchise has no more than one team in each tier.

- **4.1.2**&emsp;From highest to lowest, the tiers are Premier, Elite, Challenger, Contender, Prospect, and Recruit. When the rules mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers.

- **4.1.3**&emsp;Each franchise has at most one team per tier. Teams do not move between tiers, but players may move between teams in different tiers.

&emsp;

## 4.2 General Manager Rules

- **4.2.1**&emsp;General Managers will be selected by the Admins from candidates who have requested to be considered for a position.

    - **4.2.1.1**&emsp;GMs are not required to be a player for their team, though they are permitted to be. The GM must express their desire to be a player before the draft begins.

- **4.2.2**&emsp;GMs are the ultimate authority for their team. This means a GM can delegate responsibilities to other members of their team. However, the GM will be the main point of contact to Admins, League Staff, and other teams' GMs for all league activities, such as managing their rosters (trades/cuts/acquisitions, deciding who will play in the next match, etc).

- **4.2.3**&emsp;GMs can nominate up to 2 Assistant GMs (AGMs) who can assist the GM in managing the franchise.

    - **4.2.3.1**&emsp;A GM is allowed to switch an AGM twice per season. These switches are counted from the release of the rolling tier list to GMs until the end of the season.

         - **4.2.3.1.1**&emsp;If a GM takes over midseason, they are allowed to switch all of their allotted AGMs one time, without using their allotted switches.

        - **4.2.3.1.2**&emsp;If a GM has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing an AGM to reach the number allowed does not count as one of their switches.

        - **4.2.3.1.3**&emsp;An AGM stepping down due to leaving the league or leaving a franchise will lead to a new AGM being appointed, not an AGM switch.
        
     - **4.2.3.2**&emsp;The information shared with AGMs (channels, discussions, etc), should be kept confidential as outlined in [Section 3.3](3_csc-conduct-guidelines.md#33-privileged-knowledge).

    - **4.2.3.3**&emsp;A GM may transition a non-playing AGM to contracted status on their franchise during or before pre-draft transactions as long as that AGM either completed their most recent contract in good standing or ended their last season as a regular FA.

- **4.2.4**&emsp;GMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. A GM who does this will not become a Free Agent, but they will be eligible to return to their own roster during the season. A GM who wishes to return to their roster after being cut must treat this transaction the same as if they were picking up a Free Agent. Refer to [rule 5.5.5](5_transactions.md#55-cuts).

- **4.2.5**&emsp;If a GM who is not a player wishes to play in a future season, they must declare for the draft, and be drafted in the round which the Admins/League Staff specify.

- **4.2.6**&emsp;If a GM promotes themselves before the draft, they may not demote themselves after the draft in the same season.

&emsp;

## 4.3 Player Contracts

- **4.3.1**&emsp;Each player drafted will be given a 2 season contract with the team that selected them at the end of roster lock.

- **4.3.2**&emsp;Free agents signed by a team will go on a 2 season contract with that team.

- **4.3.3**&emsp;If a season is ongoing when a contract is signed, that season counts as the first season of the contract, regardless of how much time remains in the season.

- **4.3.4**&emsp;Any player that signs with a franchise (including off-season, preseason, and regular season signings, but excluding players acquired in the draft) must remain on an active roster until 2 match days have passed, including pre-season.

    - **4.3.4.1**&emsp;GMs attempting to circumvent this by refusing to roster a player despite their willingness and ability to play may incur punishment from admins.

    - **4.3.4.2**&emsp;Players may voluntarily opt out of this protection (including being placed on IR). This must be initiated by the player, otherwise A(GM)s may incur punishment from admins.

    - **4.3.4.3**&emsp;Resigned players cannot be cut or traded until 2 match days after the draft.

- **4.3.5**&emsp;If a signed player is willing and able to play in matches but is prevented from doing so by their franchise for a period of 2 match days, they may submit a ticket to be converted to an FA (subject to waivers when applicable).

- **4.3.6**&emsp;Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GM's approval.

    - **4.3.6.1**&emsp;Players who are cut from their team for refusing to play will become a PFA as dictated below:

       - **4.3.6.1.1**&emsp;If this is the first time a player has forced a cut from a team and...

            - There is evidence of a toxic environment or other valid reason as judged by admins, then the player will become a PFA for 1 match day. If the evidence is actionable upon former teammates this penalty may be waived by admins.

            - There is no provided evidence, then the player will become a PFA for 4 match days or the rest of the season, whichever is less.

            - There is evidence that the player is refusing to play in order to force an exit and only play on one specific team, then the player will be a PFA for the remainder of the season.

        - **4.3.6.1.2**&emsp;This is not their first incident in the current season and...

            - There has been evidence of a toxic environment(s) or other valid reason(s) as judged by admins, then the player will be given punishment by admins' discretion.

            - There has been no provided evidence in any instance, then the player will be a PFA for the remainder of the season.

- **4.3.7**&emsp;Players must only play for the team they are contracted with, except where indicated otherwise in the rules.

- **4.3.8**&emsp;Players that leave the league before their waiver period ends must re-enter the league on waivers with no tier restriction during the season or in the draft during the offseason.

- **4.3.9**&emsp;Contracts are tracked by season, where contract lengths are updated at 11:59 PM ET on the day after the last official CSC match of a season.

- **4.3.10**&emsp;When a player's contract ends they can agree to renew the contract with their existing franchise for an additional season.

    - **4.3.10.1**&emsp;If a player chooses not to renew their contract with their existing franchise, they cannot sign with that franchise again until 2 match days have passed.

    - **4.3.10.2**&emsp;If either party chooses not to renew the contract by the transaction deadline that player will become a free agent.

- **4.3.11**&emsp;Any free agent signing or contract renewal requires proof of agreement to be posted in the GM's transaction channel.

- **4.3.12**&emsp;A GM and a player may agree to put a player on Inactive Reserve (IR) at any point in a season if that player needs to take an extended break. This allows a 6th player to join the roster temporarily.

    - **4.3.12.1**&emsp;A player on IR is not allowed to play in official matches.
    
    - **4.3.12.2**&emsp;Players must remain on IR for a minimum of 4 consecutive match days or until the end of the current season, whichever occurs first. If the player was subbed out for any match days directly prior to going on IR, those match days will count towards the minimum duration.

    - **4.3.12.3**&emsp;The MMR of a player on IR will not count towards a team's total MMR, but the MMR of a replacement player will. See [section 4.5](4_league-processes.md#45-mmr).

    - **4.3.12.4**&emsp;A player on IR may only be cut, moved to PFA, or brought back to the active roster; they may not be traded, promoted, or demoted.

    - **4.3.12.5**&emsp;When a player on IR requests to return to the active roster and is eligible to do so, their GM must remove them from IR before 2 match days pass or cut them.

&emsp;

## 4.4 Franchises, Teams, And Rosters

- **4.4.1**&emsp;A team may not have more than five (5) active rostered players during the season except during the period between the draft and the roster lock following the draft.

- **4.4.2**&emsp;A team may not have less than five (5) active rostered players during the season.

- **4.4.3**&emsp;Players on IR and substitutes are not counted as active rostered players.

- **4.4.4**&emsp;In the event that a team is unable to field a substitute for a missing player in an official match, that team may play with 4 players.

- **4.4.5**&emsp;A franchise may not have more than one admin on it.

&emsp;

## 4.5 MMR

- **4.5.1**&emsp;Each player will be assigned an MMR before the draft. A player's MMR will determine which tier they play in.

- **4.5.2**&emsp;Each tier will have an MMR cap, defined as the maximum total MMR a team may have. A team's total MMR is defined as the sum of each of its active players' MMR. A team may not exceed its tier's MMR cap after the current season's roster lock.

- **4.5.3**&emsp;MMR caps will be recalculated at the beginning of every season prior to the draft.

- **4.5.4**&emsp;A GM may choose to promote a player, raising the player's MMR to the minimum individual MMR of a higher tier to allow that player to qualify for that tier. If that player is later demoted, their MMR will return to its original value. Refer to [Section 5.6](5_transactions.md#56-promotionrelegation) for promotion and demotion rules.
