# League Processes

## 4.1 General League Notes

- **4.1.1**&emsp;The concept of CSC is drawn from professional sports. CSC is composed of a series of tiers and franchises. Each franchise has no more than one team in each tier.
- **4.1.2**&emsp;From highest to lowest, our tiers are Premier, Elite, Challenger, Contender, Prospect, and Recruit. When the rules mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers.
- **4.1.3**&emsp;Each franchise has at most one team per tier. Teams do not move between tiers, but players may move between teams in different tiers.

&emsp;

## 4.2 General Manager Rules

- **4.2.1**&emsp;General Managers will be selected by the Admins from candidates who have requested to be considered for a position.

    - **4.2.1.1**&emsp;GMs are not required to be a player for their team, though they are permitted to be. The GM must express their desire to be a player before the draft begins.

        - **4.2.1.1.1**&emsp;A GM is allowed to switch who they have as AGM one time per AGM their franchise is allowed by the rules. For example, if a franchise is allowed one AGM by rule (Rule 4.2.2.1), they are allowed one switch of who is AGM per season. These switches are counted from the release of the tier maker to GMs until the end of the season.

        - **4.2.1.1.2**&emsp;If a GM takes over midseason, they are allowed to switch all of their allotted AGMs one time, without using their allotted switches.

        - **4.2.1.1.3**&emsp;If a GM has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing an AGM to reach the number allowed does not count as one of their switches.

        - **4.2.1.1.4**&emsp;An AGM stepping down due to leaving the league or leaving a franchise will lead to a new AGM being appointed, not an AGM switch

- **4.2.2**&emsp;GMs are the ultimate authority for their team. This means a GM can delegate responsibilities to other members of their team. However, the GM will be the main point of contact to Admins, League Staff, and other teams’ GMs for all league activities, such as managing their rosters (trades/cuts/acquisitions, deciding who will play in the next match, etc).

    - **4.2.2.1**&emsp;GMs can nominate up to 1 assistant GM (up to 2 if they have teams in at least 4 tiers), who can assume the responsibilities of that GM in their absence.

    - **4.2.2.2**&emsp;The information shared with assistant GMs (channels, discussions, etc), should be kept confidential as outlined in [Section 3.3](3_csc-conduct-guidelines.md#33-privileged-knowledge).

- **4.2.3**&emsp;GMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. A GM who does this will not become a Free Agent, but they will be eligible to return to their own roster during the season.

    - **4.2.3.1**&emsp;A GM who wishes to return to their roster must treat this transaction the same as if they were picking up a Free Agent. Refer to [Section 5.7](5_transactions.md#57-free-agents).

- **4.2.4**&emsp;If a GM who is not a player wishes to play in a future season, they must declare for the draft, and be drafted in the round which the Admins/League Staff specify.

    - **4.2.4.1**&emsp;If a GM promotes themselves pre-draft, they may not demote themselves after the draft in the same season.

&emsp;

## 4.3 Player Contracts

- **4.3.1**&emsp;Potential contract MMR for each player is determined when transactions open in the offseason using a formula developed by the Admins and Staff, with the assistance of other advisors.

    - **4.3.1.1**&emsp;These are the new official MMR Contract values to be used if the player signs a new contract at any point during the season.

    - **4.3.1.2**&emsp;When transactions open in the offseason, all contract’s effective MMR will be updated to their new potential contract MMR.

- **4.3.2**&emsp;Each player drafted will be given a 2-season contract with the team that selected them at the end of roster lock.

- **4.3.3**&emsp;When a team signs a free agent, they will go on a 2 season contract with the franchise.

- **4.3.4**&emsp;If a season is ongoing when a contract is signed, that season counts as the first season of the contract, regardless of how much time remains in the season.

- **4.3.5**&emsp;Any player that signs with a franchise (including off-season, preseason, and regular season signings, but excluding players acquired in the draft) must remain on an active roster until 2 match days have passed, including pre-season.

    - **4.3.5.1**&emsp;GMs attempting to circumvent this by refusing to roster a player despite their willingness and ability to play may incur punishment from admins.

    - **4.3.5.2**&emsp;Players may voluntarily opt out of this protection (including being placed on IR). This must be initiated by the player, otherwise A(GM)s may incur punishment from admins.

- **4.3.6**&emsp;Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GM’s approval.

    - **4.3.6.1**&emsp;Players who are cut from their team for refusing to play will become a PFA as dictated below based on their circumstances.

        - **4.3.6.1.1**&emsp;This is their first incident in the current season and...

            - There is evidence of a toxic environment or other valid reason as judged by admins, then the player will become a PFA for 1 Match Day. If the evidence is actionable upon former teammates this penalty may be waived by admins.

            - There is no provided evidence, then the player with become a PFA for 4 Match Days or the rest of the season, whichever is less.

            - There is evidence that the player is refusing to play in order to force an exit and only play on one specific team, then the player will be a PFA for the remainder of the season.

        - **4.3.6.1.2**&emsp;This is not their first incident in the current season and...

            - There has been no provided evidence in any instance,  then the player will be a PFA for the remainder of the season.

            - There has been evidence of a toxic environment(s) or other valid reason(s) as judged by admins, then the player will be given punishment by admins' discretion.

- **4.3.7**&emsp;Players must only play for the team they are contracted with, except where indicated otherwise in the rules.

- **4.3.8**&emsp;Players that leave the league before their waiver period ends must re-enter the league on waivers with no tier restriction during the season or in the draft during the offseason.

- **4.3.9**&emsp;Contracts are tracked by season, not by week.

    - **4.3.9.1**&emsp;Contracts end at 11:59 PM ET on the day after the last official CSC match of a season.

- **4.3.10**&emsp;When a player’s contract ends they can agree to renew the contract with their existing franchise in 1 season intervals.

    - **4.3.10.1**&emsp;If they do not renew with their previous franchise, they can’t sign with that franchise until 2 match days have passed.

    - **4.3.10.2**&emsp;If they do not renew the contract by the contract renewal deadline they become a regular free agent (they do not go through waivers) and can be signed or get picked up in the draft.

- **4.3.11**&emsp;A GM may choose to update a player’s Current Effective Contract MMR to the minimum individual player MMR of the higher tier to allow that player to qualify for that tier. Refer to [Section 5.6](5_transactions.md#57-free-agents) for promotion rules.

- **4.3.12**&emsp;Any free agent signing or contract renewal requires proof of agreement to be posted in the GM's transaction channel.

- **4.3.13**&emsp;GM’s and a player may agree to put a player on Inactive Reserve at any point in a season if they need to take an extended break. This allows a 6th man to join a roster temporarily.

    - **4.3.13.1**&emsp;This break must last a minimum of 4 match days. The duration of which will be determined by the length of unbroken absent match days in a given season and not when they were placed on IR.

    - **4.3.13.2**&emsp;The MMR of the 6th player replaces the MMR of the player on IR. MMR cap rules still apply.

    - **4.3.13.3**&emsp;A player on IR is not allowed to play any matches until they are taken off IR.

&emsp;

## 4.4 Franchises, Teams, And Rosters

- **4.4.1**&emsp;Each franchise consists of a different total number of players depending on the amount of teams a GM has within the franchise.

    - **4.4.1.1**&emsp;A team may not have more than five (5) players except during the period between the draft and the Roster Lock following the draft.

    - **4.4.1.2**&emsp;A team may not have less than five (5) rostered players.

    - **4.4.1.3**&emsp;Teams may never have more than five (5) players during the season, except between the draft and the day before match day 1.

    - **4.4.1.4**&emsp;A franchise may not have more than one admin on it (playing or non-playing).

- **4.4.2**&emsp;There are no set games played required for any rostered player.

- **4.4.3**&emsp;Teams will still be allowed to play in a match should a team suffer a player loss outside of their control in the season, resulting in having 4 active players.

    - **4.4.3.1**&emsp;The roster should be back up to 5 players by the next match day, whether the missing player is cut or put on IR.

    - **4.4.3.2**&emsp;The only transactions allowed for such teams are signing Free Agents and promoting from a lower tier.

    - **4.4.3.3**&emsp;The MMR of the player or players lost is still active against the tier MMR cap until a replacement player or players are found.

&emsp;

## 4.5 MMR Caps

- **4.5.1**&emsp;Each team has an MMR cap. Every team in a tier has the same cap.

- **4.5.2**&emsp;The caps are adjusted at the beginning of every season, prior to the draft.

- **4.5.3**&emsp;Each team must remain at or below their cap. Teams are not allowed to exceed their caps at any point, except during the period between the end of the previous season’s playoffs and the Roster Lock following the current season’s draft.

- **4.5.4**&emsp;Re-signed players must stay on a roster through the draft. They cannot be cut anytime prior to the draft. They can be cut after the draft in the preseason and would then be placed on waivers. The waivers will follow the standard waiver rules. Waivers will be the inverse of draft order. Re-signed players cannot be traded until two match days have passed.
